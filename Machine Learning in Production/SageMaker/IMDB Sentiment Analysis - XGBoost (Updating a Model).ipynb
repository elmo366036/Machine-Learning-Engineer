    "In this notebook we will consider a situation in which a model that we constructed is no longer working as we intended. In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples.
